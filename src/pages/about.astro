						<h2>It's me</h2>
						<p class="aboutme">
							I am {moment().diff("2005-07-02", "years")} years old. I have been interested in programming from the age of 12.
							Then I started learning on my own via the Internet. My first programming language was C#.
							I also created 2D and 3D games in Unity. With time, I started to broaden my knowledge and became interested
							in programming in Python. Later, my interests expanded to include new programs and various issues related
							to this subject available on the Internet, which led me to the "Cybertree" programming school, where for
							several years I have been developing my passions in this field. In addition, I try to constantly expand my
							programming knowledge by following news and curiosities on the Internet, solving Try hack me tasks or 
							answering questions on Stack Overflow. I try to reconcile my studies with my professional work.
